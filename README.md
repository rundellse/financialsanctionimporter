# financialsanctionimporter
UK Financial Sanction Importer

The intention behind this project is to create a framework for downloading the UK Consolidated Financial Sanctions list into a java format. This will be read in from the published xml. - Currently the XML is down at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list, thankfully I had grabbed a small batch of the xml before it disappeared and this can be used for test cases until the xml hosting is back up.

Intention is also to create a basic spring boot implementation for... the sake of it. Spring boot is apparently the hotness after all. Perhaps a search function would be interesting/useful and would be good for a frontend aspect.
