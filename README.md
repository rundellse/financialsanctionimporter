# financialsanctionimporter
UK Financial Sanction Importer

The intention behind this project is to create a framework for downloading the UK Consolidated Financial Sanctions list into a java format. This will be read in from the published xml.

Intention is also to create a basic spring boot implementation for... the sake of it. Perhaps a search function would be interesting/useful.
